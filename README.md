# a2zshoppe
A2Z brand e-commerce shop created by Javascript. This serves as Udacity Javascript Project _Build a Shopping Cart_ and will hopefully be used moving forward for future brand shoppe as well.

Not looking for contributions but comments welcome. Using this as a project, possibly to go live as a working shoppe in the future and mostly just to provide adequate practice for a novice coder. If you have any input on coding practices and common mistakes that beginner programmers make--please feel free to enlighten me! I love learning new tips/tricks! xoxo
